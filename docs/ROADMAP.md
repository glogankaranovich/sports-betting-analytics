### Phase 2: User-Defined Models MVP (COMPLETED - Feb 5, 2026)
**Goal:** Allow users to create custom weight-based models

**What's Included:**
- ✅ Weight-based model configuration
- ✅ 5 pre-defined data sources (team stats, odds movement, recent form, rest/schedule, head-to-head)
- ✅ Personal models only (max 5 per user)
- ✅ Simple slider-based UI with auto-normalizing weights
- ✅ Basic performance tracking (accuracy, predictions)
- ✅ DynamoDB storage (UserModels + ModelPredictions tables)
- ✅ SQS + Lambda execution pipeline
- ✅ Model predictions displayed in main analysis view
- ✅ User models in model dropdown
- ✅ Hash-based evaluators (placeholder for real data)

### Phase 2.1: User Models Enhancement (COMPLETED - Feb 8, 2026)
**Goal:** Complete user models with real data and prop support

**Completed Items:**
- ✅ Implement real data source evaluators
  - ✅ Team stats (FG%, 3PT%, Rebounds with weighted scoring)
  - ✅ Odds movement (sharp action detection, >20pt threshold)
  - ✅ Recent form (last 5 games win rate + point differential)
  - ✅ Rest/schedule (back-to-back detection, days of rest)
  - ✅ Head-to-head (historical matchup win rates)
- ✅ Add prop bet support
  - ✅ Player stats evaluator (queries PLAYER_STATS# records)
  - ✅ Player injury evaluator (placeholder for injury status)
  - ✅ Props query from DynamoDB (player_* markets)
  - ✅ UI for prop bet configuration (ModelBuilder)
- ✅ Deploy to dev and verify predictions
- ✅ Ensemble model in analytics and leaderboard
- ✅ Model name display in top analysis ticker
- ✅ Cache miss handling for analytics

**Test Coverage:**
- 179 backend tests passing
- 88% line and branch coverage
- All evaluators have comprehensive unit tests

## 🚀 Active Development (Q1 2026)

### Phase 3: Platform Enhancements (IN PROGRESS - Feb 8, 2026)
**Goal:** Privacy controls, documentation, and infrastructure improvements

**Completed:**
- ✅ Benny privacy and model access control
  - ✅ User_id filtering on all AI Agent tools
  - ✅ Users can only see their own models/predictions
  - ✅ Benny (user_id='benny') can see all for learning
  - ✅ 10 comprehensive privacy unit tests
- ✅ Model analytics cache population (EventBridge every 4 hours)
- ✅ Ensemble model in leaderboard

**In Progress:**
- [ ] Update documentation with current status
- [ ] Configure environment-specific email addresses

**Backlog:**

## 🗑️ Removed from Roadmap

### Parlay Builder
**Reason:** Complex feature with limited differentiation. Focus on AI-powered model creation instead.

**Alternative:** AI Agent can suggest optimal bet combinations based on user's custom models.

- ✅ Error handling with recovery

### Phase 2 Options - TBD

**If AI Agent:**
- Models created via AI: 100+ in first month
- User satisfaction: 4.5+ stars
- Model creation time: <10 minutes average

**If User-Defined Models:**
- Active custom models: 50+ in first month
- Model accuracy: 55%+ average
