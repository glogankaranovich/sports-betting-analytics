## Social Media Integration Considerations

**⚠️ LEGAL WARNING: Social Media Posting Restrictions**

Posting betting recommendations on Twitter/Discord creates significant legal risks:

### Major Concerns:
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Many jurisdictions restrict gambling advertising on social media
- **Platform Policies**: Twitter/Discord prohibit gambling content without proper licensing
- **Increased Liability**: Public posts = more exposure to lawsuits and regulatory action
- **Account Suspension**: Platforms may ban accounts for gambling content violations

### Safer Social Media Strategy:
- **Educational Content Only**: Post analysis methodology, not specific picks
- **Responsible Gambling Focus**: Share addiction resources and educational content
- **Market Analysis**: Discuss odds movements and trends without recommendations
- **Drive Traffic**: Use social media to direct users to compliant platform

### If Social Media Integration Needed:
- Obtain gambling advertising licenses for target jurisdictions
- Implement platform-specific compliance (Twitter Ads API, etc.)
- Create private/gated communities with age verification
- Consult with gambling law attorney before any public posting

**Recommendation**: Keep all betting recommendations on the compliant platform only. Use social media for brand awareness and education, directing users to the legally protected site for actual recommendations.
