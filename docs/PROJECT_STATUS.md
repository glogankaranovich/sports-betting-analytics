# Carpool Bets - Project Status

**Last Updated:** January 18, 2026  
**Current Phase:** System Verification & Testing

## 🎯 Project Overview

Carpool Bets is a sports betting analytics platform that uses machine learning models to analyze betting opportunities and generate actionable insights. The system collects comprehensive data, generates ML-driven analyses, and provides data-driven betting insights through a modern web interface.

## ✅ System Architecture

### Core Components (All Operational)
1. **Odds Collector** - Collects game odds and prop bets from The Odds API
2. **Analysis Generator** - Generates ML analyses for games and props using consensus model
3. **Outcome Collector** - Collects game results for verification
4. **API Handler** - Serves data via REST API with authentication
5. **React Frontend** - Displays games, analyses, and insights
6. **DynamoDB** - Stores all data with GSI indexes for efficient querying

### Recent Fixes (Jan 17-18, 2026)
- ✅ Fixed prop analysis grouping (Over/Under combination)
