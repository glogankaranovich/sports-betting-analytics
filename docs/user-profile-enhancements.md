# User Profile Enhancement Ideas

## Current State
- Profile: Email, Member Since, Last Login
- Subscription: Plan, Usage, Features
- Preferences: Default Sport, Bookmaker, Model

## Potential Additions

### Account Management
- [ ] Change password button
- [ ] Two-factor authentication toggle
- [ ] Connected accounts (Google, Apple, etc.)
- [ ] Delete account option

### User Preferences (consolidate from Settings)
- [ ] Timezone selection
- [ ] Email notification preferences
  - Daily bet summaries
  - Bet alerts
  - Model performance updates
  - New feature announcements
- [ ] Display preferences
  - Odds format (American/Decimal/Fractional)
  - Currency display
  - Date/time format

### Activity Stats
- [ ] Total bets analyzed
- [ ] Favorite sport/team
- [ ] Most used model
- [ ] Account activity summary
- [ ] Win rate tracking (if user tracks outcomes)

### Billing (if separate from Subscription)
- [ ] Payment method on file
- [ ] Billing history
- [ ] Next billing date
- [ ] Invoice downloads

### Social/Community Features (future)
- [ ] Username/display name
- [ ] Profile picture
- [ ] Bio/about section
- [ ] Public profile toggle
- [ ] Share model performance

## Recommended Priority
1. Email notification preferences (high value, low effort)
2. Change password (security essential)
3. Timezone/display preferences (UX improvement)
4. Activity stats (engagement driver)
5. Two-factor authentication (security enhancement)

## Notes
- Keep Profile page minimal and focused on account security
- Move all app preferences to Preferences page
- Subscription page should focus on plan management and usage
